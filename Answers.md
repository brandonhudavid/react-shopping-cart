Keep your answers to each checkoff question here for safe keeping. You will need to copy them over to the submission form at the end of the project. 

1. ReactDOM.render is rendering a Cart component in the "root" div of index.html
2. Pros: easy to create simple interface with someone else's abstractions. Cons: cannot make own edits to design.
3. Must wrap addToCart in another function so addToCart does not simply get called when assigning it to onClick.
4. a) We defined a Product component with an addToCart function that handles adding things to our cart.
4. b) In case our data changes, we will not need to change any hardcoded lines of code.


1. Midterm seating tracker. Have to maintain which seats are occupied and persist those changes if the browser refreshes.
2. Parent-to-child communication through props. Child-to-parent through a function. Why? (idk)
3. Iterate through products in cartItems, checking productName. Increment/decrement count. 



State?
- List of products [Products]
  - Product with (name, price)
- Total cost
-
